## My process

### Built with

- HTML 5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to make multiple things change while hovering over one element. I'm very proud of my outcome

This is my code:
```
.card-img{
    position: relative;
	display: flex;
	align-items: center;
	overflow: hidden;
}

.card-img img{
    border-radius: 0.4rem;
}

.card-img #view{
    display: none;
    position: absolute;
	top: 50%;
	left: 50%;
	transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
	z-index: 1;
    width: 3rem;
}

.card-img:hover, .card-img:active{
    cursor: pointer;
    background-color: var(--secondary-color);
    border-radius: 0.4rem;
}

.card-img:hover #view{
    display: block;
}

.card-img:hover #nft-pic{
    opacity: 0.5;
}

#nft-pic{
    border-radius:0.4rem;
    max-width: 100%;
}
```
